      \begin{itemize}
      \Large
      \item<1-> The segmentation mask approach effectively overcomes the challenges of variable
        outputs and occluded corners in calibration pattern detection.
      \item<2-> U-Net models were successfully employed but exhibited overfitting due to dataset limitations.
      \item<3-> Using a pre-trained ResNet50 backbone improved performance%, achieving 85\% accuracy on the validation set.
      \item<4->  This method streamlines the calibration
evaluation process, reducing manual effort and improving overall usability. 
      \end{itemize}
