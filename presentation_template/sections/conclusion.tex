      \begin{itemize}
      \Large
      \item<1-> The segmentation mask approach effectively overcomes the challenges of variable
        outputs and occluded corners in calibration pattern detection.
      \item<2->  A U-Net model with a pretrained ResNet50 backbone delivered superior performance
        compared to more complex transfer learning models like DeepLabV3.
      \item<3->  This method streamlines the calibration
evaluation process, reducing manual effort and improving overall usability. 
      \end{itemize}
