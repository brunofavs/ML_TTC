\subsection{Transfer Learning with DeepLabV3 and Resnet50 Backbone}

Using transfer learning with a pretrained DeepLabv3 model was the first option considered. DeepLabV3 is a complex model designed for
image segmentation. Including the Resnet50 backbone, which is a CNN, the model has in total around 41M parameters. Upon freezing the
backbone, we were left with 17M trainable parameters. The pretrained model came from PyTorch built-in models and was originally trained
on a subset of known COCO dataset, using only the 20 categories that are present in the Pascal VOC dataset, mainly consisting of big
every objects like cars, planes, sofas, bicycle...

The train was conducted using the Adam optimizer and cross entropy loss, batch size of 4 and 10 epochs. Our dataset had 80 images. We
found the loss to stay constant and high, meaning our model was not learning anything from the training. We figured that the dataset
that the model was originally trained on was too different from ours and the model could not learn within a feasible number of epochs
with only 80 images. In addition to that, we latter found out that this model has an auxiliary output that must be used in the training 
phase. We couldn't figure out how to deal with this auxiliary output, so we decided to attempt using simpler segmentation model, the U-Net.
