\subsection{Data preparation}

% The data we had:
%   -  Images with corners labeled
%
% Captured more images to have more dataset diversity with other types of calibration patterns
%
% Developed a annotation program to label corners of the patterns. 
% Developed a program to convert labeled corners into segmentation masks that served later to train the models.

We initially had a dataset consisting of images with labeled outer corners of a ChArUco board, specifically the four corners that
define the physical boundary of the pattern. To improve dataset diversity, we captured additional images featuring different types of
calibration patterns.

To facilitate data annotation, we developed a program to label these outer corners bypassing the usual calibration pipeline necessary
to obtain these annotations. Additionally, we created a program to convert the labeled corners into segmentation masks, which were
later used for model training.
