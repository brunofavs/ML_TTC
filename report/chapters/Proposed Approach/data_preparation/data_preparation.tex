\subsection{Data preparation}

The data we had:
  -  Images with corners labeled

Captured more images to have more dataset diversity with other types of calibration patterns

Developed a annotation program to label corners of the patterns. 
Developed a program to convert labeled corners into segmentation masks that served later to train the models.
