\subsection{Model selection and training setup}
To select the models, we prioritized the availability of source code and 
pre-trained weights. The PyTorch Vision framework currently provides three 
models for semantic segmentation: DeepLabV3~\cite{DeepLabV3}, FCN~\cite{fcn}, 
and LRASPP~\cite{LRASPP}. Among these, we selected DeepLabV3, as the authors 
reported the best results.

In addition to the PyTorch models, we sought a simple and well-established model 
to serve as a baseline. For this purpose, we chose U-Net~\cite{unet}.

Since this problem involves only one class of interest—the checkerboard—with all 
other pixels considered background, it can be framed as a binary classification 
task at the pixel level. Consequently, we selected a loss function designed for 
binary classification: binary cross-entropy loss.

For optimization, we experimented with the Adam optimizer due to its fast 
convergence and adaptive learning rates. Additionally, we evaluated Adam with 
Weight Decay to mitigate potential overfitting.

For batch size, we used the maximum value that the GPU could accommodate.
