\subsection{Why use segmentation models}

Using a more simple CNN/FC combo to find just the coordinates of the corners of the pattern was not feasible as the size of the output is not
constant and a neural network with dynamic outputs is much more complex. More often than not, at least one corner of the pattern is
clipped in the image. If one corner is clipped, 5 points are instead needed to draw lines on the 4 sides of the pattern. If 2 adjacent corners
are clipped, only 3 sides are visible. The solution we found to answer this problem is to find the segmentation mask of the pattern
instead and compute the edges afterward with classical computer vision.
