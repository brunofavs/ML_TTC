\section{Conclusion}

We presented a approach to automate the annotation of the outer borders of a calibration patterns using deep learning. By leveraging
segmentation models instead of direct CNN/FC combos, we addressed challenges related to pattern occlusions and variable output sizes.
While transfer learning with DeepLabV3 did not yield satisfactory results, training a U-Net model with a ResNet50 backbone proved
highly effective. This approach streamlines the evaluation process, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy. Future work
could focus on further refining the model.
